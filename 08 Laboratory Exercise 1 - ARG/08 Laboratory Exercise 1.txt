1. Write a Java program which displays leap years from 1900 to 2400 starting from the user's valid input.
Take note of the following:
A year is a leap year (and so contains a February 29) if it is divisible by 4. But if the year is also divisible by 100 then it is not a leap year, unless it is divisible by 400. This means that years such as 1992 and 1996 are leap years because they are divisible by 4 and are not affected by the rest of the rule which applies to century years such as 1900 and 2000. Century years are not leap years except where they are a multiple of 400. Hence, the years are not leap years 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not leap years and did not contain a February 29. But the year 2000 was a leap year, the first such century leap year since 1600.
Valid inputs are leap year. Display an appropriate message if the user entered an invalid number.
The program will continue to ask a year not unless the user entered 0, in which case the program will be terminated.
Name the class LeapYearChecker
Enter a year: 1800
Invalid input. Input should be between 1900 to 2400
Enter a year: 1900
Invalid input. Input is not a leap year.
Enter a year: 2392
2392 is a leap year
2396 is a leap year
2400 is a leap year
Enter a year: 0
You entered 0. Program will terminate.
List of leap years from 1900 to 2400.
