Using NetBeans, create a program that asks the user for the number of male and female students registered in a class/section. The program should display the total number of students and the percentage of males and females in the class.

 

Sample output:

Enter the number of males: 36

Enter the number of females: 17

Number of students = 53

Male = 67.92%

Female = 32.08%
