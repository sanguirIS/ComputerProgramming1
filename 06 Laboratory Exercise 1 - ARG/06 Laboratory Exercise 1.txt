Using NetBeans, create a program that computes and displays a game character's attack speed at a certain level. Use the formula below.

Current attack speed = Base attack speed * (1 + (Bonus attack speed % * (Level - 1)))

The variable for level should be of int type. The bonus attack speed % should be converted to decimal (divide by 100) before multiplying by the level. For example, if the user enters 4% for the bonus attack speed, the formula will use 0.04 instead of 4. Round the current attack speed to the nearest three (3) decimal places.

 

Sample output:

Enter the base attack speed: 0.658

Enter the bonus attack speed %: 4

Enter the level: 10

The character's current attack speed is 0.895.
